# Greechie_Diagrams
This is my Dissertation Project on Greechie Diagrams using Python. I have utilized the Graphviz and Numpy modules. Greechie diagrams are very similar to Hasse diagrams in Discrete Mathematics. 
This project has multiple functions that each generate a variety of Greechie diagrams. 
There are 3 other functions that validate Greechie diagrams and Orthoalgebras and also generate Hasse diagrams for valid Orthoalgebras.
